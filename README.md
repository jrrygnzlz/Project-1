# Welcome to my Project Repository for Dr. Marguerite Butler's ZOOL710 class at UH Manoa

# Projects
Project 1: Data cleaning, and some analyzation so we only need the Data and Code folders.
Project 2: Analyzing the cleaned data, so we need the Data, Code, Results, and Products folders
Project 3: Analyze your own data with data cleaning, analysis, and report preparation. 

For now lets focus on Project 1.

### In Project 1 the main focus is to:
 1) Clean the palmer penguins data set
 2) Analyze it further
 3) Make it reproducible for others to use

To access my Project 1 finalized scripts and QMD go to: Code --> Processing Code

To access my Project 1 finalized html structure (script) go to: docs

# Getting started
This is a Github template repository. The best way to get it and start using it is [by following these steps.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

Clone the reposiory to your computer, then push it to your GitHub

Once you got the repository, you can check out the examples by executing them in order. 
 1.  First run the processing code, which will produce the processed data. 
 2.  Then run the analysis scripts, which will take the processed data and produce some results. 
 3.  Then you can run the manuscript, poster and slides example files in any order. Those files pull in the generated results and display them. These files also pull in references from the `bibtex` file and format them according to the CSL style.

 # Software requirements
This template lays out a data analysis project and report writing using R, Quarto, Github and a reference manager for bibtex. A plain text editor is also necessary, and wordprocessing software to open .docx if you wish to use that format (e.g. MS Word, MacOS Pages, or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)).
