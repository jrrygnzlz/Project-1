# Welcome to my Project Repository for Dr. Marguerite Butler's ZOOL710 class at UH Manoa
In this Repository consists of 3 projects, for now lets focus on Project 1.

In Project 1 the main focus is to:
 1) Clean the palmer penguins data set
 2) Analyze it further
 3) Make it reproducible for others to use

To access my Project 1 finalized scripts, QMD, and html go to:
      Code --> Processing Code

# Getting started

This is a Github template repository. The best way to get it and start using it is [by following these steps.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

Clone the reposiory to your computer, then push it to your GitHub

Once you got the repository, you can check out the examples by executing them in order. 
 1.  First run the processing code, which will produce the processed data. 
 2.  Then run the analysis scripts, which will take the processed data and produce some results. 
 3.  Then you can run the manuscript, poster and slides example files in any order. Those files pull in the generated results and display them. These files also pull in references from the `bibtex` file and format them according to the CSL style.

# Template content

All of the folders contain template files that should filled with some content required for your analysis. Look inside each folder for template files that provide examples of the types of content that go there. 

The template files also demonstrate how information is linked together across folders. 

Please see the `README.md` files in each folder for more details.

* This template has been populated with _Palmer Penguins_ morphology and life history data in the `Raw_data` folder. 
* The `Processing_code` folder contains several files that load the raw data, perform a bit of cleaning, and save the result in the `Processed_data` folder. 
* The `Analysis_code` folder contains several files that load the processed data, do an exploratory analysis, and fit a simple model. These files produce figures and some numeric output (tables), which are saved to the `results` folder.
* The `Products` folder contains an example `bibtex` and CSL style files for references. Those files are used by the example manuscript and slides.
* The  `Manuscript` folder contains a template for a report written as Quarto file. There is also a sub-folder containing an example template for a supplementary material file as is common in scientific articles these days.
* The `slides` folder contains a basic example of slides made with Quarto. 

# Projects
1. For the first project, we are focusing on data cleaning, so we only have Data and Code folders.
2. For the second project, we are analyzing the cleaned data, so have Data, Code, Results, and Products folders
3. For the third project, please analyze your own data with data cleaning, analysis, and report preparation. 

 # Software requirements

This template lays out a data analysis project and report writing using R, Quarto, Github and a reference manager for bibtex. A plain text editor is also necessary, and wordprocessing software to open .docx if you wish to use that format (e.g. MS Word, MacOS Pages, or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)).
